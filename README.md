Welcome to the Space Simulator, a Python-based planet simulator using the Pygame library. This simulation provides an interactive environment to explore the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies in our solar system.

Introduction

The Planet Simulator is a visually engaging tool that allows users to observe the dynamics of planetary motion in a two-dimensional space. With accurate gravitational calculations, this simulation provides a realistic representation of celestial mechanics.
Features

    Realistic Gravitational Physics: Accurate gravitational formulas simulate the forces between planets, resulting in realistic celestial mechanics.

    Interactive Environment: Easily add, remove, and modify planets during the simulation to observe their gravitational interactions.

    Customizable Settings: Adjust parameters such as gravitational constant, time step, and initial conditions to customize the simulation.

    Visual Feedback: Each planet is represented by a colored circle, and their orbits are visually displayed, providing clear feedback on their movements.

Getting Started

To run the Planet Simulator, ensure you have Python installed along with the Pygame library. Follow the steps below:

    Install Pygame: pip install pygame
    Copy the provided Python code into a file (e.g., planet_simulator.py).
    Run the script: python planet_simulator.py

Controls

    Quit: Close the simulation window to exit the program.

Dependencies

    Python 3.x
    Pygame library

Installation

You can install the Pygame library using the following command:

bash

pip install pygame

Usage

    Upon running the simulator, you will observe the gravitational interactions between the Sun and various planets.
    Planets are represented by colored circles, and their orbits are displayed on the screen.
    Explore the source code to customize settings, add new planets, or modify existing ones.
